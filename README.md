# Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis

This project focuses on data analysis using different statistical methodologies applied to a public dataset from a Portuguese banking institution's marketing campaign [Moro S., Rita P., Cortez P. (2014). Bank Marketing UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing). All analyses and models are developed independently.

The primary goal of this project is to adhere to proper statistical assumptions, frameworks, and to ensure the precise interpretation of values. Avoiding misinterpretation, manipulation, and misrepresentation of statistical concepts is fundamental to the integrity of the analysis.

This project addresses a binary classification problem, where the objective is to predict whether a client subscribes to a term deposit based on various features. To achieve this, I employ a **Generalized Linear Model (GLM)**, which is explored under two different statistical philosophies: the **Frequentist** and **Bayesian** approaches.

## Key Features of the Project:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset undergoes cleaning, feature selection, and transformation to ensure the quality and relevance of the input variables.
2. **Modeling Approaches**:
   - **Frequentist Approach**: The model is estimated using traditional maximum likelihood estimation methods.
   - **Bayesian Approach**: A probabilistic model is used, incorporating prior beliefs and updating them with observed data using Bayes' theorem.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Both models are evaluated using various performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC, to assess and compare their predictive performance.
4. **Interpretation**: Careful interpretation of the model's results is emphasized, ensuring that the conclusions drawn are statistically valid and meaningful.


**Dataset**: [Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing): used 'bank.csv' file insted of 'bank_full.csv' for computational reasons.

## Objective:
The main objective of this project is to provide an in-depth understanding of the differences in philosophy, methodology, and results between the Frequentist and Bayesian approaches. The project serves to highlight how each statistical framework tackles uncertainty, incorporates prior knowledge, and handles model inference in the context of a real-world dataset.
